# Battleship Carnage - Architecture Document

## 1. System Overview

Battleship Carnage is a browser-based multiplayer naval combat game with a top-down retro aesthetic. The system follows a client-server architecture with the following key components:

- **Client Application**: Browser-based game interface built with React and WebGL
- **Game Server**: Real-time game state management and synchronization
- **Database**: Persistent storage for player data and game statistics
- **Cache**: In-memory storage for session data and real-time events

## 2. Component Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with WebGL for rendering, organized into the following layers:

#### Presentation Layer
- **Game Canvas**: WebGL-rendered game world
- **UI Components**: React-based interface elements (menus, HUD, leaderboards)
- **Audio System**: Sound effects and background music

#### Game Logic Layer
- **Input Controller**: Handles keyboard/mouse inputs
- **Physics Engine**: Manages ship movement, collision detection
- **Rendering Engine**: Handles sprite rendering and animations
- **Particle System**: Manages visual effects (explosions, water splashes)

#### Network Layer
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time communication with the game server
- **State Synchronization**: Reconciles client-side prediction with server state
- **Latency Compensation**: Implements techniques to handle network delays

### 2.2 Backend Architecture

The backend consists of several interconnected services:

#### Game Server
- **Game Loop**: Updates game state at fixed intervals
- **Physics Simulation**: Calculates ship movements and collisions
- **Combat System**: Manages weapons, damage, and ship destruction
- **AI Controller**: Manages behavior of AI-controlled ships

#### Network Services
- **WebSocket Server**: Handles real-time client connections
- **Session Manager**: Tracks active player sessions
- **Matchmaking Service**: Balances player distribution across instances

#### Persistence Layer
- **Player Database**: Stores player profiles, stats, and progression
- **Game State Cache**: Maintains current game state in memory
- **Analytics Service**: Collects gameplay metrics for balancing

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Player Input**: Client captures user input (keyboard/mouse)
2. **Client-Side Prediction**: Local game state updated immediately
3. **Input Transmission**: Actions sent to server via WebSocket
4. **Server Processing**: Server validates and processes player actions
5. **State Update**: Server updates global game state
6. **State Broadcast**: Updated state sent to all relevant clients
7. **Client Reconciliation**: Client adjusts local state based on server data

## 4. Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Rendering**: WebGL
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Network**: Socket.IO client

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Game Server**: Custom game loop with Socket.IO
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data
- **Cache**: Redis for session data and real-time events
- **Deployment**: Fly.io or DigitalOcean

## 5. Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple game server instances with load balancing
- **Sharding**: Dividing the game world into manageable zones
- **Interest Management**: Only sending updates relevant to each player
- **Database Partitioning**: Separating read-heavy and write-heavy operations

## 6. Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based player authentication
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all client inputs
- **Anti-Cheat Measures**: Server authority for all game-critical calculations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of action spamming and DDoS protection

## 7. Development and Deployment Pipeline

- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- **Environment Strategy**: Development, Staging, and Production environments
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and error tracking

## 8. Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to accommodate future features:
- Weather system integration
- Team-based gameplay modes
- Voice chat and ping system
- Ship customization system
- Interactive map elements
